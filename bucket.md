1. I created a google bucket from the `cloud.google.com`
    a. to access the bucket from the google-engine instance you need to stop the machine
    b. click the instance name.  After the instance's properties page opens, click `Edit` and change permission at the bottom.
    c. I change permissions to allow access to all API's, which is simpler but not recommended by google.
